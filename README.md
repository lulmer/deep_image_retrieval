# Presentation 
**An AI based Image Retrieval System**
In this project we will build an information retrieval system. We have a query image and we want to retrieve the most visually similar image for a given dataset. The main idea is to extract relevant vectorial features from images in order to measure a meaningfull similarity distance.
# How to use it 
## Consultation Only
The `demo.iypnb` file is a notebook that contains all the workflow for the project, with details, comments and results, therefore you can use it as an example and reuse some pieces of codes in your pipelines scripts.

## Executing the notebook
If you are interrest in executing this `demo.iypnb` notebook and reproduce the results. 
* 1- Fork the repository 
* 2- Download the dataset (link is in the notebook)
* 3- Replace the path of impor the cell (commented on the notebook)
